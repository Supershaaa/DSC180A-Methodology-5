**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
I think the most interesting topic in this quarter is how to implement GPFA on the spike dataset that we only know about the observed Y value to learn the latent variables X and A that enable us to
learn the pattern of mice's behavior and their reaction or decision time so that we could predict the behavior of the mice.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** 
In the next quarter, we will access to the IBL data and practically use the data on the GPFA model. And I would like to pursue the pattern of mice's behavior.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
Now stage, we know that the GPFA also has issues like it counts the data and the poission model doesn't have closed form for parameters. So I think we will change or use other technique to
improve the GPFA.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I would be interested in the technique that collects the spiking data and how to get the sorting spiking data.
